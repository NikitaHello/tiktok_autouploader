### Automation guide:

Installation instructions for Windows Task Scheduler for automation. If you are using UNIX systems, you need to set up Cron.

To access Windows Task Scheduler, use the Win+R key combination and enter taskschd.msc. Alternatively, search for it through the standard Windows search.

Then follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Task Scheduler Library: In the Task Scheduler window, on the left-hand side, navigate to "Task Scheduler Library". This is where you'll see existing tasks and where you'll create a new one.

2. Create a New Task: Right-click on "Task Scheduler Library" and select "Create Basic Task" or "Create Task" from the context menu. Both options will allow you to create a new task, but the latter offers more advanced options.

3. Name and Description: Give your task a name and an optional description to help you identify it later. You can use something like "TiktokScheduler".
In Security options section choose "Run whether user logged on or not", "Run with highest privileges", "Hidden", "Configure for: Windows *** (choose your win version)".

4. Choose Trigger: Select when you want the task to start. You can choose from options like "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", or "At log on". Follow the prompts to set the specific details for your chosen trigger.

5. Action: Select "Start a program".
Settings.
Find "upload_start.bat" file in your repository. Copy the path with the file name attached and insert into Program/Script section. Like this: ...\TiktokAutoUploader\upload_start.bat
Copy the path without file name and insert into "Start in" section. This is a mandatory field for our settings. Like this: ...\TiktokAutoUploader

6. Set Conditions: Unset all checkboxes.
   
7. Settings.
Set checkboxes:
Allow task to be run on demand;
Run task as soon as possible after a scheduled start is missed;
If task fails, fails every: 5 mins, 2 attempts;
Stop the task if it runs longer than: 4 hours;
If the task does not end when requested, force it to stop;

8. Finish: Review your settings and click "OK" to create the task. You may be asked to enter your user password for Windows.
