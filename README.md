  Before automation you need to manualy launch first video uploade to your tik-tok channel. This have to be done as a workaround to problem with downloading age-restricted videos from youtube. 
Find **...\TiktokAutoUploader\upload_start.bat** file in project repository and launch it. Next follow the messages in cli, log in your youtube account to create cookie cache, so you won't need to do this next time.

To access Windows Task Scheduler, use the Win+R key combination and enter taskschd.msc. Alternatively, search for it through the standard Windows search.

Then follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Task Scheduler Library: In the Task Scheduler window, on the left-hand side, navigate to "Task Scheduler Library". This is where you'll see existing tasks and where you'll create a new one.

2. Create a New Task: Right-click on "Task Scheduler Library" and select "Create Basic Task" or "Create Task" from the context menu. Both options will allow you to create a new task, but the latter offers more advanced options.

3. Name and Description: Give your task a name and an optional description to help you identify it later. You can use something like "TiktokScheduler".
In Security options section choose "Run whether user logged on or not", "Run with highest privileges", "Hidden", "Configure for: Windows *** (choose your win version)".

4. Choose Trigger: Select when you want the task to start. You can choose from options like "Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", or "At log on". Follow the prompts to set the specific details for your chosen trigger.
